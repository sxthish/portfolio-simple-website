# My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills and provides information about me. I've built this website using HTML for structure and basic CSS for styling.

## Pages

1. **Home Page:** The main landing page introducing me and highlighting my skills.

2. **Contact Page:** A page where you can find information on how to get in touch with me.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: Used for the structure and semantics of the web pages.
- CSS3: Applied for styling and layout to enhance the visual appeal.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
   - Navigate to the home page (`index.html`) for an overview of my skills and introduction.
   - Visit the contact page (`contact.html`) to find information on how to contact me.
